"""Depth-gated sentence splitter for the reading-tab loaders.

Net-new and self-contained: this module owns the Japanese character policy
(there is no shared scanner to reuse — the old Yomitan-derived one was deleted
in 3e10353). A single left-to-right pass tracks bracket/quote depth; a
terminator run at depth 0 ends a sentence, a run inside brackets does not. A run
of two-or-more ``．`` (or the ellipsis marks ``…‥``) is an ellipsis, not a
terminator, so ``……。`` still splits on the ``。``. Only *matched* bracket pairs
gate depth: a pre-scan (``_matched_openers``) pairs openers to closers, so an
unmatched opener and an unmatched closer are both treated as ordinary characters
and cannot suppress splitting. The unterminated tail is flushed.

The module constants below are the Japanese policy and stay the behaviour of a
``rules=None`` call, byte for byte. Another language passes its profile's
``SentenceRules`` instead; ``space_aware`` is what lets a terminator set that
contains ``.`` (Korean's) leave ``3.14`` and ``Dr.`` alone, by requiring the run
to be followed by whitespace or end-of-text. ``abbreviations`` adds the period
model for a language whose ``.`` is also an abbreviation dot (``Dr.``, ``z.B.``)
and whose ``...`` is an ellipsis; an empty set keeps that model off. Under
``space_aware``, a run followed by whitespace, an optional dialogue dash and a
lowercase letter does not end the sentence either (``A 3. emeleten``,
``¿Vienes? —preguntó``): a cased sentence never starts lowercase, and an
uncased script has no lowercase letter to trip it.
