"""Normalisation and simplified/traditional variant generation for zh (spec 10.1).

OpenCC performs no Unicode normalisation of its own, so every string crossing
into it goes through :func:`normalize_zh` first — the one shared rule the spec
pins, reused by the dictionary key folding, so import-time and query-time keys
can never disagree. The profile's ``normalize`` field is
:func:`normalize_zh_text`, which adds the radical fold and the renderer-garbage
strip that only mined text needs.

OpenCC is optional, and its absence is degradation rather than disablement
(``availability.ZH_OPTIONAL_PACKAGES`` states the same thing): simplified input
never reaches a converter, while traditional input loses segmentation and
readings — the tokenizer cuts a simplified copy of every line — along with the
script-variant lookups and the Traditional field. It therefore stays out of the
availability gate (``availability.zh_missing_required_reason``) and is named
only by ``availability.zh_unavailable_reason``, which lists the whole stack.
