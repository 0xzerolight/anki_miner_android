"""Rows jieba's shipped dictionary gets wrong, and what the zh tagger does instead.

Both tables were derived from a census of jieba's whole ``dict.txt`` crossed
with CC-CEDICT, plus what real subtitle material loses to the POS gate; every
row was checked against CC-CEDICT, and every one was kept only because its own
frame was measured against the real cut.

ZH_FLAG_OVERRIDES  jieba's flag for a word jieba's own dictionary mis-files.
                   Applied to the flag jieba emits, on the SIMPLIFIED segment,
                   after the cut - so it can never move a token boundary.

ZH_SPLIT_ENTRIES   jieba dictionary rows that fuse a verb and its object, a
                   classifier and its noun, or a word and sentence-final 吧
                   into one token. Removed from the tagger's PRIVATE dictionary
                   with del_word, which DOES move the cut.
