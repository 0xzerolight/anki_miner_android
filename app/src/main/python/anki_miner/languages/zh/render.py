"""zh card render hooks (spec 9.1).

Each hook returns LOGICAL ``anki_fields`` keys; EpisodeProcessor phase 5 merges
them into ``extra_fields`` and ``anki_note_builder`` maps key -> Anki field name.
An unmapped key is skipped by the existing empty-name rule, so every hook field
is opt-in exactly like frequency/pitch/expression_audio.

    CC-CEDICT writes a two-script classifier as ``trad|simp`` (``CL:輛|辆``), so

    put a traditional glyph on a simplified learner's card and read as two
    classifiers. The halves are PICKED, never converted: ``to_script`` does not
    fold 隻 to 只, and the dictionary already supplies the pair.

    With no variant set ("As written", and every yue card) the card's script is
    read off the text itself, front before sentence, and ``prefer`` is the
    answer when neither carries a script — a front spelt the same in both
    (狗, 朋友, and every Cantonese-only glyph), or an install with no OpenCC,
    which is what ``anki-miner[yue]`` is. yue therefore builds this hook
    traditional-first; zh takes the default.

    First classifier only, deliberately: a word with several (``CL:部,片,張|张``)

    nothing to escape, so the off branch stays character-identical to the plain

    romanisation whose word boundaries are the spaces (yín háng, not yínháng),
    and the coloured field has to read like the plain one beside it.

    reading of the front: the two fields sit next to each other on the card and
