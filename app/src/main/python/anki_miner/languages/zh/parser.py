"""zh SubtitleParser factory (the profile's ``create_parser`` field).

The service is the shared ``SubtitleParserService`` — nothing is subclassed.
Its tokenizer arrives through ``tagger_provider.get_tagger(config.language)``,
wired at Stage 1A. The profile's ``MinedFormPolicy`` IS injected here: without
it ``TokenizedWord.mined_form`` falls back to the JA ``select_mined_form``.
This factory exists so the profile can name a callable without the registry
importing the parser (and, transitively, fugashi) at profile-build time.
