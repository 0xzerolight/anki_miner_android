Data only. The Qt-level plumbing that consumes ``ZH_CONTENT_STYLE``
(``gui/utils/content_text.py``, the QSS selectors, the font-database probe)
belongs to Stage 2B; this module exists because ``build_profile()`` cannot name
a ``content_style`` whose value has no source.

Nothing here imports ``anki_miner.gui``: ``languages`` carries no import-time
edge into ``gui`` (pinned by
``test_languages_package_carries_no_import_time_gui_edge``).
