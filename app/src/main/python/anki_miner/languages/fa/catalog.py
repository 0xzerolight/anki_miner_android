"""Recommended downloadable Persian resources (spec C.2).

**Dictionary — wty-fa-en** (``yomidevs/wiktionary-to-yomitan``, hosted on HuggingFace
``daxida/wty-release``). Wiktionary content extracted through kaikki.org, CC BY-SA 4.0. The build
this branch was written against is revision **2026.09.19**, 3,328,547 B, sha256
``0654d5b24ae8b405b0959909a2947e13d7c6df8564607aba215f0edc2e5931a9`` — recorded here because the
URL is a moving ``latest/`` pointer and ``ResourceSpec`` has no digest field to pin it with (no
catalogue row in the project pins one). The same build is what
``anki_miner/languages/fa/data/compound_verbs.tsv`` was derived from, so the two agree about which
noun + light-verb pairs are real compounds. 16,965 of its 17,040 lemma rows carry the Grammar head
line the romanisation card field reads, and its 4,655 ``mi``-prefixed redirect rows carry no ZWNJ at
all, which is why the lookup ladder has a ZWNJ-stripped rung.

Manual imports, not rows (every catalogue row starts ticked in the setup wizard, and a second
dictionary should not download by default): **wty-fa-en-ipa**, the same build with IPA on the head
line, under ``latest/dict/fa/en/`` on the same host, and the legacy **kty-fa-en** r2 build, which is
not on that host: its last copy is the ``kty-fa-en.zip`` asset of the ``yomidevs/wiktionary-to-yomitan``
GitHub release ``v2025-04-08-10-54-36-00-00``.

**Frequency — OpenSubtitles 2018** (``hermitdave/FrequencyWords``, ``content/2018/fa/fa_50k.txt``),
content CC BY-SA 4.0: headerless ``word count`` lines over surface forms, imported in occurrence
mode and lemmatised in-app (``lemmatise=True``, R21). Persian needs that more than most: a single
verb spreads over hundreds of conjugated rows, and the list's very first entry is a bare Persian
comma, which the script gate drops. No converter script and no release asset exist for fa — the
spec's hand-built lemma list would have duplicated what the in-app lemmatiser does with the same
tables the tokenizer already loads.
