"""Russian data for the shared spaCy substrate (spec Appendix B ru column; plan D3, D7-D10).

``strip_stress`` / ``ru_normalize``: learner texts and some subtitles mark stress with an acute (rarely
a grave): a marked ``читал книгу`` tags as two PROPN tokens unless the marks go. Only a mark on a
Cyrillic letter goes, so ``café`` in a Russian line keeps its accent; й and ё are letters (breve,
diaeresis) and stay.

``RU_KEYS``: a dictionary term folds case, stress and ё->е (texts write е for ё at will), the lt shape.
A reading keeps its stress and its ё — they are the point of the reading — except the acute on a
one-vowel word, which is redundant and splits one reading in two (OpenRussian writes дом, wty marks
it): over the 1,500 most frequent content lemmas the fold takes S24's ambiguous count from 155 to 52.

``RU_EXCLUDED_SUBTYPES`` is empty: ``ru_core_news_sm`` has no fine tagset (``tag_ == pos_``), so
``pos2`` is always ``""``.

``RU_SENTENCE_RULES``: Russian quotes with guillemets and, inside those, the low quote, which the left
double quote closes — so that quote leaves the shared openers (where it is the English opener) for the
closers. It also continues a sentence after the spaced abbreviations the derived tokenizer set leaves
out (``т. е.``, ``5 ч.``).
