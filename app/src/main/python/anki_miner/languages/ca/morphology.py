"""Catalan data for the shared spaCy substrate (spec Appendix E, ca column).

``CA_EXCLUDED_SUBTYPES`` is empty on evidence: ``ca_core_news_sm`` has no
trained tagger, so ``tag_`` copies ``pos_`` on every token (0 of 59,483 UD
Catalan AnCora test tokens differ) and ``pos2`` is always ``""`` — dead config,
as for ko (E.2.1, D11).

``CA_ABBREVIATIONS`` is seeded from the dotted entries of spaCy's Catalan
tokenizer exceptions (``spacy/lang/ca/tokenizer_exceptions.py``), casefolded
with the final dot dropped, plus ``núm`` (listed there without its dot, written
``núm.``). ``set`` (setembre) is left out: ``Tinc set.`` and ``Són les set.``
end sentences. The shared single-letter exceptions are not taken either.

The interpunct: ``col·legi`` is written with U+00B7 and every wty-ca-en key
uses it (2,836 ``l·l`` keys; none spelled ``l.l``, ``l-l`` or with U+0140). In
the wild it degrades to ``col.legi``, ``col-legi`` or ``colegi``, so
``interpunct_variants`` maps those back as lookup-only rungs (R35, D6); the
opposite direction never meets a key.

``CA_LEADING_WORDS`` feeds the shared ``spaced_dedup_fold``, which also strips
the glued elided article (``l'home`` meets the mined ``home``).
