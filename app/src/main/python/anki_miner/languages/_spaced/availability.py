"""Can this machine mine a spaCy language? (the profile's ``unavailable_reason``).

Two hard requirements: the spaCy runtime and the language's model package.
Each is satisfied by an importable package (a pip install with the language's
extra, plus the model wheel) OR by the in-app pack on disk (``_spacy`` for the
runtime, the language's own pack for the model). ``find_spec`` answers without
importing anything, so probing costs nothing. No language branch: the code,
English name and model package are the caller's data.
