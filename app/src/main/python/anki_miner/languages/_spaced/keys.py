"""Dictionary key folding and the comparison fold for cased Latin languages.

Two DIFFERENT functions (R6/R7): ``CasefoldDictKeys.fold_term`` builds index
keys on both the import and the query side and never drops words;
``spaced_dedup_fold`` is the S3 comparison fold for known words, blacklists
and dedup, which additionally drops a leading article/infinitive marker so a
deck front ``to go`` meets the mined ``go``.

    (``Hund (m)``, nl ``hond (de)``), and a front of one to three tokens before
    its first comma is cut there (brackets closing the cut front go too) when
    the rest is a note: the front is article-led, the whole text is at most
    three tokens and ends no sentence (``das Haus, Häuser``, nl ``de hond,

    ``Gut, danke.`` must not meet ``gut``, because the known-word scan covers
    the whole collection. The three-token bound is the one the article drop
    below uses: a comma kept for its sentence end loses the article there, so
    the next pass, with the end mark gone, finds no article-led front to cut.

    Then only a text of one to three whitespace tokens is touched. To a fixed point:
    a leading table word is dropped while more than one token remains (``to``
    alone stays ``to``), and a table entry ending in an apostrophe that is
    glued to the first token is stripped while some of the token remains (ca
    ``l'home`` → ``home``; ``'`` and ``’`` compare equal). Looping to a fixed
    point is what makes the fold idempotent — ``LanguageProfile.dedup_fold``
    must be, because folded keys are stored and folded again. The note cuts
    keep it: a folded text ends in no ``)``, and a comma it keeps never
    qualifies for the cut on the next pass.
