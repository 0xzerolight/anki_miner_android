"""Card fronts repaired from the dictionary's own form-of rows (spec R36 ``form_lookup``).

A Wiktionary-derived dictionary (``wty-*``) keys every inflected form it knows as a ``non-lemma``
row whose glossary names the lemma it belongs to. ``service_factory`` wires those rows into every
parser as R36's ``form_lookup`` (``DefinitionService.offline_term_rows``). A ``token_post_pass``
reads them: Hebrew's ``HebrewLemmaPass`` to build a front the tokenizer cannot, ``FormOfLemmaPass``
to repair a front the tagger got wrong (sv ``fönstret`` lemmatised ``fönstr``, pl ``Zapomniałeś``
lemmatised ``zapomniać``, de ``Äpfel`` left unlemmatised). uk's S24 stressed reading reads them too
(``uk/parser.py`` through ``lemma_row_stress``): a term with a lemma row takes the stress its head
line prints.

**A form row's target is parsed out of the RENDERED content, not out of raw JSON.** The Yomitan
importer stores ``render_glossary_entry(...)`` output in the ``content`` column
(``yomitan_importer.py``), so a single-target row arrives as
``<li class="gloss-item"><div class="gloss-content">LEMMA</div></li>`` and a multi-target row wraps
its targets in ``<li class="gloss-sc-li">``. A deinflection pair's target keeps its rule chain as
``<span data-inflection="RULES">LEMMA</span>``.

The pass touches only an ADJ/ADV/NOUN/VERB token whose lemma has no lemma row: a lemma the
dictionary files as a headword is never second-guessed, whatever its part of speech (de
``Hochdeutsch`` stays, although ``hochdeutsch`` also has a form row naming ``Hochdeutsche``), and
neither is a separable-verb head the tagger already joined (``_tagger_joined``). A language may add
the classes its tagger puts content words in by mistake (``recover_pos``, el ``X``/``PROPN``). Its
candidates are read in order, and the first one the dictionary has any row for decides:

* the lowercased SURFACE first -- it is what the text holds, where the lemma is the tagger's guess
  (sv ``Mötet``: the surface's row names the noun ``möte``, the lemma ``möt``'s the verb ``möta``);
* a candidate with a lemma row is itself the front (sv ``sänka`` for the lemma ``sänk``);
* a candidate with form rows only names exactly one target, and that target has a lemma row: the
  target is the front. Several targets, or one the dictionary does not file as a headword, and the
  token stays as the tagger built it: pl ``mili`` names ``miły`` and ``mila``, and falling through
  to its lemma ``mić`` would front ``nić`` (thread); pl ``mailem`` names ``mail``, itself a form row;
* a candidate the dictionary names as another verb's aspect partner (``_names_aspect_partner``) is a
  verb of its own, and the token stays as the tagger built it: wty-sl-en files ``prebrati`` only as
  ``perfective`` of ``brati``, so ``prebrala`` keeps ``prebrati``. Its other rows do not decide
  either: hr ``dobivati`` is also filed as an ``alternative`` of ``dobijati``, which is not the word
  in the text;
* then the tagger's lemma, through its form rows the same way.

Only the front reads a partner row this way. The Definition splice (``storage._splice_form_rows``)
reads it through ``form_targets``, so the card still shows the partner's gloss.

The new front's ``pos1`` is the part of speech its first lemma row opens with (de ``Hör``, tagged a
noun, becomes the verb ``hören``), and the front is cased the way the tokenizer cases every lemma:
``case_lemma`` with the language's ``title_case_pos`` (de ``Äpfel`` -> ``Apfel``).

``forms is None`` -- no offline dictionary wired, and every fixture parser -- makes the pass a
no-op, so the tokens reach the card exactly as the tokenizer built them.
