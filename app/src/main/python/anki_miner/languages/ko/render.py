"""Korean-only card fields, merged into extra_fields by _phase5_create.

The hook reads the mined spelling with getattr(word, "mined_form", ""):
EpisodeProcessor._apply_render_hooks passes the TokenizedWord itself, and any
AttributeError raised here is swallowed by that loop's except - the field would
just never appear on the card, with only a warning in the log.

One hook, not two: the planned NIKL vocabulary-grade field is void, because the
learner-grade list it would read is KOGL Type 4 and permits no derivative.

    appears in subtitles and older prose - is covered here.

    A word written in hanja only (學校) is the one case that also moves the
    front: KRDICT's hanja-keyed row bolds the hangul headword, which goes out
    as CARD_FRONT_KEY (학교 on the front, 學校 in the Hanja field). With no
    such headword the front stays the hanja and the Hanja field stays empty,
    since it would only repeat the front. mined_form is untouched either way,
    so lookups key on the hanja; Anki holds the moved front, so the known
    gate reads it through card_front.

    The han ranges are languages/ko/script.py's, shared with the known-word
    ingestion gate, so the two can never disagree about what a hanja is.
