"""Korean script classification, normalisation, sentence rules, dict folding.

NFC normalisation is not cosmetic: macOS filenames and some subtitle sources
carry NFD hangul, where 학 is three conjoining jamo. Un-composed text compares
unequal to every dictionary key, so normalisation runs before any lookup,
storage or known-word comparison.

contains_target_script is the ingestion/mining gate: Korean accepts hangul OR
han, because Sino-Korean words appear in hanja in subtitles and dictionaries and
a hangul-only gate would silently drop them.
