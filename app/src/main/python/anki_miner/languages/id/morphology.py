"""Indonesian folds, lookup ladder and POS tables (spec C.5).

No engine: Indonesian inflects only by affixation, so the card front is the surface as met,
casefolded and stripped of combining marks (``bukunya``, ``buku-buku``, ``nggak``), and the
lookup-miss ladder is the rule table in :mod:`anki_miner.languages.id.rules`, validated by the
installed dictionary (first hit wins).
