"""Finnish tokenizer: ``fi_core_news_sm`` through the shared spaCy adapter.

No parser: Finnish has no separable-particle join (E.1), and excluding the parser changes no lemma, POS, fine tag or
morph (0 of 3,000 example sentences differ). No hyphen join: spaCy's Finnish infixes never split an ASCII hyphen, so
``linja-auto`` is one token already. Curly apostrophes are folded in the tagging copy only: tagged as written, the
consonant-gradation apostrophe of ``ruo'an`` splits the word into ``ruo`` + the apostrophe + ``an``. The S8
abbreviation set is the sentence splitter's, so only those dotted exceptions stay glued (``esim.``, ``mm.``).

A capitalised content word the model returns unlemmatised is re-lemmatised in lowercase (the shared S2 repair): on
UD Finnish TDT dev+test it lifts sentence-initial content lemmas from 64.4 % to 74.0 % and all content lemmas from
75.9 % to 76.7 %, and leaves every PROPN decision unchanged.
