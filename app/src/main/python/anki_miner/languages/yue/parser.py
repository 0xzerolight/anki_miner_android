"""yue SubtitleParser factory (the profile's ``create_parser`` field).

The service is the shared ``SubtitleParserService`` -- nothing is subclassed.
The tokenizer arrives through ``tagger_provider.get_tagger(config.language)``.
The shared spaced factory fills the seams below; this one adds the ellipsis guard
and the split pass (``YueDecompoundPass``).

``script_gate`` is the one seam this factory closes that zh leaves open: in
sentence context the tagger gives Latin and digit runs ordinary tags (measured:
``Netflix`` NOUN, ``2024`` NOUN, ``8`` NOUN), so POS cannot exclude them and the
Han gate has to. zh does not need this because jieba tags Latin ``eng``/``x``,
outside its allowed set.

``compound_matching=False`` (S7) -- the matcher greedily joins adjacent tokens
against the installed dictionary, and Cantonese has no spaces to stop it. With
CC-CEDICT-Canto carrying 163,280 mostly written-Chinese headwords, leaving it on
turns the top risk of this language (written Chinese under Cantonese dialogue)
into a mining behaviour. th closes it for the same reason.

    The segmenter glues adverbs, aspect markers, particles and pronouns onto the
    word next to them (好忙, 瞓緊覺, 煮啦, 佢住). The glued token is no headword,
    so the word inside it never became a card. A splittable token is a miss only
    when the probe attests neither it nor a spelling the lookup ladder tries for
    it (甚麼 is defined as 什麼, so it stays whole). A miss is cut by longest
    match, and only when the probe attests EVERY piece. A separable verb-object
    compound (拍緊拖) comes apart into its literal pieces too; that is accepted.

    The re-segmented line is re-tagged in one ``pos_tag`` call through the
    lock-guarded tagger, so each piece is tagged in sentence context and
    ``YUE_TAG_OVERRIDES`` applies (a freed 緊 or 啦 is PART). Only the pieces
    take those tags: every token the pass did not split is returned as it came,
    with its first tag. Two probe calls per line at most: the suspects with
    their ladder spellings, then every inner substring of the misses.
    ``attest is None`` (no offline dictionary) makes the pass inert. The third
    argument (R36's form lookup) is ignored.
