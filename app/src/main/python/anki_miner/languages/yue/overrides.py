"""Words pycantonese tags wrong in every context, and the tag the yue tagger gives them.

zh's ``ZH_FLAG_OVERRIDES`` shape, reimplemented rather than imported (R32).
``YueTagger`` applies it to the tag ``pos_tag`` emits for a whole segmented word,
keyed on the engine's word, so it can never move a token boundary. Every row is
a CC-Canto or CC-CEDICT-Canto headword.
