"""pycantonese-backed tokenizer producing fugashi-shaped duck tokens.

Emits ``LanguageToken`` (NOT ``morphology.SyntheticToken``): that class's
isinstance gates drive ja-only attested-reading and span-replacement merge
passes, and a Cantonese token caught by them would be swept into Japanese
morphology.

**The surface is the verbatim slice ``line[start:end]``, the lemma is the
engine's word.** ``segment(line, offsets=True)`` hands back both, and they differ
only when the segmenter joined across an interior space (``今 日好開心`` ->
slice ``今 日``, word ``今日``). Taking the word as the surface would be silently
destructive: ``morphology.iter_token_spans`` has to stitch a space-free surface
across the whitespace and then DROPS it (``morphology.py:487``), so the word
would vanish from the mined set with no error anywhere. The space-free spelling
still reaches the card front, because ``YueMinedFormPolicy`` prefers the lemma.

Cantonese is isolating: there is no inflection, so the lemma is the word as
segmented and ``kana`` is empty. ``pos1`` is the universal tag; ``pos2`` is
``"stopword"`` for a member of the engine's 104-word list and ``""`` otherwise --
a tier the POS editor can exclude, offered and off by default.

Latin, digit and punctuation tokens are emitted so the spans stay aligned with
the line. Their tags are not trustworthy (measured in sentence context:
``Netflix`` NOUN, ``2024`` NOUN, ``IQ題`` NOUN, and fullwidth Latin glues onto
the preceding particle as one ``嘅ＡＢＣ`` PART token), which is why the profile
excludes them with the Han script gate and never with POS. ``YUE_TAG_OVERRIDES``
corrects the Han words the model tags wrong in every context.

**Each run between punctuation marks is segmented on its own**, together with
the mark that closes it, and each mark is a token of its own. The segmenter
strips punctuation only off a predicted word's ends, so a whole-line segment
emitted ``塞緊車，行告士打道`` as one word: a dictionary miss that cost every
word in it. The closing mark stays in the segmented text because the segmenter
reads it as context for the run's last word (``飲嘢？``). The tags still come
from ONE ``pos_tag`` call over the whole line, so each word keeps its sentence
context.
