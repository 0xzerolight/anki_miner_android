"""The Hebrew lookup ladder: one rung list, shared by the form resolver and the curator (spec F.2).

Hebrew writes its prepositions, its conjunction, its definite article and its relativiser as single
letters glued to the front of the word, and ``wty-he-en`` keys almost none of those forms. Probed
against the real build: ``bsefer``, ``vehayeladim``, ``bevayit``, ``she'ani`` and ``keshehu`` have
no key at ANY spelling, so the rungs are mandatory rather than an optimisation.

``rungs`` is the single source of both ladders. ``HebrewLookupStrategy.candidates`` returns it minus
the whole-word entry -- which is what satisfies both halves of the language contract
(``word not in texts`` and ``len(texts) == len(set(texts))``) -- and ``HebrewLemmaPass`` walks the
same list with the whole word in front, so the resolver and the definition lookup cannot drift.

Enclitic possessives are deliberately absent (spec section 9): modern speech uses ``shel``, and a
blind suffix strip over-generates on two- and three-letter stems. Ktiv male and haser variants are
absent for the same reason -- wty keys both spellings for many lemmas anyway.
