"""Hebrew script support: the character ranges, the P3 normaliser, the key fold, the gate, sentence rules, SDH regex.

``he_normalize`` is what the parser applies to every line. Niqqud STAYS: vocalised children's
content and Tanakh text keep their points in the stored card sentence (S5), and it is the fold at
the comparison and lookup seams -- not the normaliser -- that makes a pointed spelling and a bare
one meet. NBSP becomes a space and every format character but ZWNJ/ZWJ goes, which is what removes
the RLM/RLE Windows subtitle tools inject (the ar precedent).

``he_fold`` is the dictionary-key and comparison fold (R33): NFC, drop every ``Cf``, drop every
combining mark of the Hebrew block. The maqaf, geresh and gershayim are kept -- they spell
construct forms and abbreviations, and ``kelev-`` resolves through the dictionary's own form table
-- and a final letter is never folded to its medial form.

**Every codepoint bound here is an integer over ``ord``, never a character range and never a
backslash-u escape.** The harness decodes such an escape inside a comparison into the literal
character; the result is visible, so no scan catches it, and the next reader cannot see what the
bound is. ``ar/script.py`` is the shipped precedent for the ordinal-tuple plus class-body shape.
