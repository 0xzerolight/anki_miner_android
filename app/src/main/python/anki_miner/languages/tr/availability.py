"""Can this machine mine Turkish? (the profile's ``unavailable_reason``).

One hard requirement, zeyrek: an importable package (a pip install with the ``tr`` extra) OR the Turkish pack on
disk, whose other components (nltk, regex, defusedxml, colorama) always install with it. ``find_spec`` answers
without importing, through the spaCy languages' own probe helpers.
