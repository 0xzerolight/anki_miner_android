"""Polish data for the shared spaCy substrate (spec Appendix B pl column, §4.3).

``PL_EXCLUDED_SUBTYPES`` comes from real ``pl_core_news_sm`` 3.8.0 output, not
from the NKJP tagset documentation. ``pos_`` is the morphologizer's and ``tag_``
the tagger's, two independent predictions, so a closed-class NKJP tag can sit
under an allowed UPOS. Over 7,933 wty-pl-en 2026.08.29 example sentences
(statistics only) the tags under NOUN/VERB/ADJ/ADV whose lemma is almost never
an n/v/adj/adv headword are excluded: INTERP (``+``; 3 of 239), XXX (foreign
words: ``For``, ``using``, ``cum``; 13 of 198), ADJA (compound-adjective stems
``gastro``, ``roz``; 13 of 64), CONJ (``tym``, ``jak``; 4 of 22), PREP
(``gwoli``, ``wokół``), COMP (``zeby``, ``coby``), INTERJ (``precz``, ``kurde``),
PPRON12/PPRON3/SIEBIE (pronouns: ``mię``, ``je``, ``se``), NUMCOL (``dwojga``),
BURK (``trosze``, ``zamian``). AGLT (the ``-(e)m/-(e)ś/-(e)śmy`` agglutinate) is
the one tag excluded on tagset grounds rather than by that measured rule: its
single observed token (``byliśmy`` → ``być``) is a headword, but the tag marks a
clitic that is never a word to mine, and that token's lemma tail is what
``drop_agglutinate_tail`` repairs. Kept on the same evidence: QUB (``właśnie``,
``zbyt``: 91 of 149), NUM (``dużo``, ``mało``, ``trochę``), PRED (``można``,
``trzeba``), BREV and ``_SP`` (real words the tagger mislabels: ``chcesz``,
``Chcę``), WINIEN, BEDZIE, GER, IMPS, PCON, PANT.

``PL_ABBREVIATIONS``: spaCy ships no Polish tokenizer exceptions, so the set is
hand-written from the PWN spelling rules (sjp.pwn.pl/zasady, fetched
2026-09-17: [205] initial letters of a word, [207] a multi-word name with one
dot, [208] a dot after each word, [337] a truncated word), every dotted example
those rules print, plus eight common abbreviations of the same shapes (``np tj
tzn tzw str pok św ks``). Left out on purpose, because the undotted stem is an
ordinary word that ends sentences: ``ok`` (``OK.``), ``im`` (``Powiedz im.``),
``min`` (genitive plural of ``mina``). The same set feeds the sentence splitter
and ``build_spacy_tagger(abbreviations=...)``; ``abbreviation_cases`` lists the
dotted spellings ``pl/tokenizer.py`` keeps whole, because the tokenizer splits
the dot off (``str.`` → ``str`` tagged NOUN, lemma ``stręp``) and only a dotted
token is the shared ``X`` abbreviation.

``drop_agglutinate_tail``: PDB splits a past or conditional verb from its person
and conditional clitics (``widziałem`` = ``widział`` + ``em``), and the trained
lemmatiser joins their lemmas with spaces: ``widziałem`` → ``widzieć być``,
``mógłbyś`` → ``móc by być`` (202 of 4,447 VERB/AUX tokens on the UD Polish PDB
test split). The card front keeps the verb.

``drop_plurale_tantum_gender``: PDB tags pluralia tantum ``Gender=Neut|Number=Ptan``
(``drzwi``, ``spodnie``, ``okulary``). That is a treebank convention, not a
gender, and the gender field would print ``n``.

``pl_dedup_fold``: Polish decks write a reflexive verb with its particle after
it (``bać się``) while the mined front is the verb (``bać``; ``się`` is a
pronoun, never on the front, spec §2). The shared fold only drops LEADING words,
so the trailing ``się`` is dropped here.
