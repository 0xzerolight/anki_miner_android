    back into the live fields, or — on a first visit — the profile's

    ``language_stash`` holds a snapshot for every language that is NOT active,

    ``language`` is portable through a settings import while ``language_stash``
    is machine-specific and stripped from it, so an import can land a config
    whose active language already has a local parked snapshot. ``new_code`` is
    folded the same way ``AnkiMinerConfig.__post_init__`` folds ``language``
    and the stash keys, because keying the stash off an unnormalized code would
    leave the now-active language parked.

    ``scoped_defaults`` values (the config's own default objects) are copied,
