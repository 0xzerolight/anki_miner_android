"""Process-wide {language: tagger} cache; a language switch evicts the outgoing entry (S23).

``"ja"`` delegates to services.tagger.get_shared_tagger() unchanged — the
single-flight LockedTagger contract stays exactly where it is. Later stages add
their branch inside ``_build``, never inside ``get_tagger``, so the cache write
always happens.
