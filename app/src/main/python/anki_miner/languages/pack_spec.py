"""Data shapes for downloadable dependency packs.

A language that needs third-party engines in frozen bundles ships a
``languages/<code>/pack.py`` exporting ``PACK: LanguagePack``. Japanese has
none: its engine is bundled. These types are shared by the per-language packs
(``languages/<code>/pack.py``) and the ASR engine pack (``services/asr/asr_pack.py``).
They are pure data so that importing a manifest can never pull an engine, a
downloader, or Qt.
