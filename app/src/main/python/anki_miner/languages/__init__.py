"""Per-language mining support.

Stage 0 declares only the code vocabulary. Profile types, the registry and the
ja/ko/zh profiles arrive in later stages and are imported from
``anki_miner.languages.registry`` — never re-exported here. ``profile.py``
imports ``anki_miner.services.resource_catalog`` at module level, so an eager
re-export would drag the service layer into every ``import anki_miner.languages``.
Nothing in this module may import Qt, a tokenizer, or anki_miner.services —
config-time and packaging cost stays nil.
