    The one ladder decoder in the app: the reading loaders, the word lists and
    the Manage Known Words importer all come through here, so the Big5 rule
    below is written once. *encodings* is the mining language's
    ``get_profile(...).import_encodings``; a caller with a default of its own
    resolves it before calling, because ``()`` is an EMPTY ladder and never a
    "use the default" sentinel.

    Exactly ordered first-success, with no Japanese heuristic on top: nothing
    here knows which of several successful decodes of another language's bytes
    is the right one. Exhausting the ladder raises rather than returning a
    replacement-character string, because a novel that decoded to U+FFFD noise
    would mine into cards. The one lossy success is a UTF-8 leg on a file that
    is UTF-8 but for a few stray bytes (``mostly_utf8``): only those bytes
    become U+FFFD, where the next single-byte leg would garble every line.

    A single-byte leg (cp1252, cp1258, …) must also pass
    ``plausible_single_byte_text`` with *script_check* — such codecs almost never
    raise — and its result is NFC-composed: cp1258 decodes Vietnamese to
    combining sequences, and the decoded text becomes the card sentence.

    ``prefers_big5`` weighs the whole input, so a Big5 file under roughly ten
    words scores below its threshold and gb18030 still wins it.

    The winning encoding comes back with the text: mojibake is reported as "the
    words are wrong", never as an encoding name, so a caller's receipt cannot
    name the leg that produced it unless this says which one won.

    A UTF-32/UTF-16 BOM replaces the ladder, the precedence the subtitle loader
    (``utils/subtitle_encoding.py``) applies: every single-byte leg decodes
    UTF-16 (Excel's "Unicode Text") without raising, into NUL-riddled words
    that pass its plausibility check. UTF-32 goes first because its
    little-endian BOM starts with UTF-16's.
