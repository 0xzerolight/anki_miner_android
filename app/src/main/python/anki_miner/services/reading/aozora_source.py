"""Load one ``.txt`` novel (Aozora Bunko markup or plain text) into units.

Pure stdlib, no chardet dependency. The detector hands a ``txt`` ref whose
``title`` is a provisional file-stem label; for Aozora files the header title
here becomes the authoritative document title/episode, so this loader is the
final say on metadata (series is always the constant ``"Books"``).

Transform order on an Aozora body line is fixed: **gaiji → ruby → annotations**.
Gaiji must resolve first so a gaiji-produced kanji can anchor a ruby base and so
its inner ``［＃`` never looks like an annotation; ruby strips before annotations
so a ``《reading》`` can't confuse the annotation scanner.
