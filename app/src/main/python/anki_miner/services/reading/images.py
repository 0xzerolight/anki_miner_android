"""Materialize deferred page/cover images into downscaled card JPEGs.

Reading-tab cards carry a manga page or book cover. ``ImageRef`` defers the
actual bytes until card creation; this module turns one ref into a small RGB
JPEG on disk. Stateless by contract: the output name is a hash of the ref, so
the same ref always maps to the same file and repeat calls short-circuit on the
existing file (a filesystem-level memo — no module state). Output names are
hash-derived, never taken from an archive entry name, so a hostile member name
can never influence the written path.
