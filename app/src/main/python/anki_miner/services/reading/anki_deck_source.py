"""Load an existing Anki deck's notes as per-card reading units (kind="deck").

Issue #131: premade subs2srs / movies2anki / asbplayer decks carry a subtitle
line, its audio clip and a picture per card, but no target word. Each note
becomes one :class:`ReadingUnit`, mined like a subtitle cue; the card's own
clip and picture ride along as files in Anki's ``collection.media`` and are
uploaded again, under content-addressed names, for the cards mined from it. The
source deck is only ever read.

Config-free and uses no Qt APIs, like the other loaders: warnings are plain strings.
