"""What a YouTube download still needs before mining: a transcribed or an aligned subtitle.

Shared by ``EpisodeProcessor.process_youtube_url`` and ``--api fetch``.
Qt-free: a step is reported by its key and the caller names it in its own
words. The ASR and retime entry points are imported inside the functions, as
the processor imported them, so tests that patch those module attributes keep
reaching them.

    Returns None when the alignment was cancelled — the outcome carries that

    Best-effort by contract: ``retime_subtitle`` never raises for content or
    tool reasons — every failure comes back as a falsy ``RetimeOutcome`` with
    the original file untouched — so alignment can degrade but never fail a
    run. YouTube's auto-captions being out of sync is why this exists.

    Writes a sibling rather than overwriting: ``retime_subtitle`` keeps no
    copy when ``out_sub`` is ``in_sub``, and a bad alignment must not destroy
    the captions we would otherwise mine.
