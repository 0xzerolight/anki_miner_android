"""SQLite-backed read provider for a single indexed frequency source.

Mirrors :class:`~anki_miner.services.dictionary.providers.indexed_provider.IndexedDictProvider`:
opens the per-source ``index.sqlite`` (built by the frequency source importer)
read-only, validates its ``schema_version``, and exposes term -> rank lookups.

Lookups are reading-scoped (see :func:`_select_scoped_row`): a homograph's rare
reading no longer inherits a common reading's rank. When the caller supplies no
reading, the term-only ``MIN(rank)`` is used (unchanged legacy behavior, and the
compatibility path for reading-less sources).

Threading: the read-only connection is opened with ``check_same_thread=False``
so one provider instance is safe to share across threads (constructed on the GUI
thread, consumed by worker threads), the same contract as IndexedDictProvider.
