#: rather than kept as part of the first entry. Not a ladder — it is the single
#: encoding this file was read with before any language had one, and it stays
#: the answer for Japanese, whose ladder cannot be walked first-success (EUC-JP
#: bytes decode as cp932 without raising, and the mojibake matches nothing).
