"""Shared AnkiConnect HTTP helper.

Internal-but-tested: the leading underscore marks this as a private module, yet it
has no public facade because it is an implementation seam shared by the AnkiConnect
services. White-box unit tests import it directly and patch
``anki_miner.services._ankiconnect.requests.post`` at many sites (see
``tests/unit/test_anki_service.py``) to drive the HTTP layer without a live Anki. The
underscore therefore stays and the module path is a deliberately stable test surface;
do not rename it or reroute those patch targets.

In production, ``post_action``/``post_multi`` send through one shared, lazily
created ``requests.Session`` (see ``_post``) so the 20-200 calls a typical run
makes reuse a keep-alive TCP connection instead of paying a fresh
socket+TLS-free handshake per call. This is invisible to the patch seam above:
``_post`` compares the live ``requests.post`` against the original captured at
import time, and if a test has replaced it, routes the call through the patched
callable instead of the session. Do not call ``requests.post`` directly from new
code in this module - go through ``_post`` so both the keep-alive path and the
patch seam keep working.
