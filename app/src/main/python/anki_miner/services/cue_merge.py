"""Which neighbouring subtitle cues belong to the word's own sentence.

A subtitle sentence is routinely split across two or three cues, so the cue a
word was mined from is often a fragment. This module decides — purely, from the
cue list alone — how many cues on each side finish that sentence, and returns
the answer in exactly the shape ``TokenizedWord.line_expansion`` already
carries (Issue #120): the Word Curator stamps the same pair by hand, and
``WordFilterService.expand_word_lines`` materialises both the same way. Nothing
here merges text or times; the intent is all it produces.

The terminator/ellipsis/closer sets come from the mining language's
``SentenceRules`` (``languages/profile.py``), so ja/ko/zh bring their own
punctuation and no call site branches on a language code. ``rules`` is a
parameter rather than a lookup so this module stays a leaf.

``SentenceRules.space_aware`` needs no handling here: it exists so a terminator
set containing ``.`` (Korean's) requires whitespace or end-of-text after the
run, and a cue's own end is always end-of-text.

Every bound is a module constant, never a setting: the one setting this feature
adds (``config.merge_incomplete_cues``) is the on/off switch.
