"""Self-contained per-field glossary ``<style>`` block (Yomitan model).

Anki Miner emits glossary CSS *inside each styled field* as one TRAILING
``<style>`` block, so styling travels with the note — it works on any note type,
on AnkiDroid/mobile, in exports, and when a card is shared, and nothing can strip
or de-sync it. This is how Yomitan delivers glossary CSS (self-contained field
HTML), and it replaces the shared note-type CSS block that the v2.7.6 rework
introduced (Anki Miner no longer writes note-type styling at all).

Two placement invariants, both load-bearing for JS-driven note types (Kiku
class) that hold fields in inert ``<template>`` elements and re-inject them
page-by-page through ``DOMParser`` → ``doc.body.innerHTML``:

* **Per field, not per card.** A ``<style>`` in one field is only card-wide on
  note types that render all fields into one live document. Field-isolating
  note types show each field alone, so EVERY styled field must carry its own
  block (Yomitan does the same and duplicates dict CSS across fields).
* **Trailing, never leading.** The HTML parser hoists a *leading* ``<style>``
  into ``<head>``, so any ``body.innerHTML`` round-trip silently drops it; a
  trailing block stays in ``<body>`` and survives (jsdom-verified against
  Kiku's actual pipeline). ``attach_card_style_block`` is the only sanctioned
  attach seam and enforces both invariants.

The block is ``[tree-shaken base glossary.css] + [scoped per-dictionary CSS]``
(base → dict-author, following the Yomitan ``_getCustomCss`` ordering). The base
sheet is minified on embed (comments + whitespace stripped) and **tree-shaken
per card** (Issue #93): ``glossary.css`` is partitioned by ``@am-group`` marker
comments into an always-embedded core plus witness-gated groups
(unstyled-chrome / sc-gapfill / images / tables), and a group is embedded only
when the card's own HTML carries markup its rules could match
(``css_witnesses``). Dropping rules that cannot match anything on the card is
semantics-preserving by construction, so the render is identical on every Anki
client; detection errs toward over-inclusion (wasted bytes, never a missing
style). Only the base — which we author — is minified; a dictionary's own CSS is
embedded verbatim.

Pure string transform: no Qt, no HTTP, no disk I/O beyond ``load_glossary_css``'s
bundled read. The scoped per-dictionary CSS is gathered separately by
``definition_service.collect_dictionary_css`` and passed in as ``dict_css``.

# naive global pass whenever no comma/semicolon lives inside a quoted string —
