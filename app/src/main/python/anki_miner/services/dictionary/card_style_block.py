"""Self-contained per-card glossary ``<style>`` block (Yomitan model).

Anki Miner emits each card's glossary CSS *inside the card's own field* as one
``<style>`` block, so styling travels with the note — it works on any note type,
on AnkiDroid/mobile, in exports, and when a card is shared, and nothing can strip
or de-sync it. This is how Yomitan delivers glossary CSS (self-contained field
HTML), and it replaces the shared note-type CSS block that the v2.7.6 rework
introduced (Anki Miner no longer writes note-type styling at all).

The block is ``[tree-shaken base glossary.css] + [scoped per-dictionary CSS]``
(base → dict-author, following the Yomitan ``_getCustomCss`` ordering). The base
sheet is minified on embed (comments + whitespace stripped) and **tree-shaken
per card** (Issue #93): ``glossary.css`` is partitioned by ``@am-group`` marker
comments into an always-embedded core plus witness-gated groups
(unstyled-chrome / sc-gapfill / images / tables), and a group is embedded only
when the card's own HTML carries markup its rules could match
(``css_witnesses``). Dropping rules that cannot match anything on the card is
semantics-preserving by construction, so the render is identical on every Anki
client; detection errs toward over-inclusion (wasted bytes, never a missing
style). Only the base — which we author — is minified; a dictionary's own CSS is
embedded verbatim.

Pure string transform: no Qt, no HTTP, no disk I/O beyond ``load_glossary_css``'s
bundled read. The scoped per-dictionary CSS is gathered separately by
``definition_service.collect_dictionary_css`` and passed in as ``dict_css``.

# Conservative CSS minifier: strip /* */ comments, collapse all whitespace runs
# to a single space, and tighten spacing around block/statement delimiters. It
# deliberately does NOT touch spacing around ``:`` or ``>`` so selector combinators
# and property values (e.g. ``mask-image: var(--image)``, ``a > b``) are never
# altered. Safe for our authored glossary.css; halves its embedded size.
#
# String-literal aware: whitespace collapsing and delimiter-tightening run only
# OUTSIDE quoted strings, and ``/* */`` inside a string is literal text, not a
# comment. So a rule like ``content: "a, b"`` keeps its comma/space verbatim
# instead of being corrupted to ``content:"a,b"``. Output is byte-identical to a
# naive global pass whenever no comma/semicolon lives inside a quoted string —
# which is true of today's glossary.css (its only commas are ``rgba()``/

# ``data-sc-content="glossary"``, but that is styled by ``core`` (``.gloss-sc-ul``),
# so a coarse check kept the ~4.6 KB group on every card for nothing — defeating
# the Issue #93 tree-shake on the common (unstyled JMdict) case.
#
# The match form is load-bearing; do NOT "simplify" it to a bare value substring:
#   * exact ``=`` selector (``[data-sc-content="forms"]``) → the literal WITH its
#     closing quote, so ``formsTable``/``antonyms``/``gloss-tag`` cannot collide
#     with ``forms``/``antonym``/``tag`` and fire on every card;
#   * ``|=`` selector (``[data-sc-content|="frequency"]`` — matches the value OR a

#     quote, so ``frequency-nf01`` still fires. A closing-quoted literal there
#     would MISS the suffixed form and strip a needed style — the one forbidden
#     outcome; the open prefix is a safe superset. The renderer always emits
