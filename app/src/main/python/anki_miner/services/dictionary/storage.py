"""SQLite storage layer for indexed dictionaries.

This module owns the schema and all low-level read/write primitives.
Importers populate; providers query.

Note on connection idiom: This module deliberately uses explicit ``try/finally
conn.close()`` rather than ``with sqlite3.connect()`` as a context manager.
Reason: the sqlite3 ``with`` block commits/rolls back but does NOT close the
connection — we close explicitly so the db file is not held open across the
