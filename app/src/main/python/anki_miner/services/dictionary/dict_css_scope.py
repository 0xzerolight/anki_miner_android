"""Scope a dictionary's ``styles.css`` to its own glossary markup (Issue #87).

Yomitan dictionaries (Jitendex, NHK, 三省堂, pitch dicts, …) ship a ``styles.css``
at the root of their zip that styles the structured-content DOM they emit — tag
pills, example-sentence boxes, forms tables, and so on. anki_miner historically
ignored that file, so its cards rendered dictionary content unstyled (Issue #87,
"Bug 1").

This module replicates Yomitan's own Anki behavior: prefix every top-level
selector with ``.yomitan-glossary [data-dictionary="<title>"]`` and emit the
result inline as a ``<style>`` block on each card. Two things fall out of that
scope: the rules only ever match the *miner's* glossary markup for *this*
dictionary, so one dict's CSS never bleeds into another's entries.

Because the output is injected verbatim into an HTML ``<style>`` element inside a
card field, the CSS is third-party and untrusted. We sanitize defensively:

* Rules referencing remote/dynamic resources (``url()``, ``image-set()``,
  ``expression()``, …) are dropped wholesale.
* Any rule whose text contains ``<`` is dropped — a ``</style>`` sequence would
  otherwise terminate the ``<style>`` element early and allow HTML injection.
  The prelude is checked *comment-stripped* (its comments are never emitted; they
  are dropped when the selector list is re-serialized), but the body is checked
  *raw* (it is emitted verbatim, comments included, so a ``</style>`` inside a
  body comment really would break out).
* At-rules other than the conditional group rules (``@media`` / ``@supports`` /
  ``@container`` / ``@layer``) are removed — notably ``@import`` and
  ``@font-face`` (remote fetch vectors).

The parser is intentionally hand-rolled (no CSS library dependency, matching
:mod:`anki_miner.services.dictionary.yomitan_renderer`). It does not resolve CSS
nesting: a rule body is kept verbatim, so a dictionary's own ``&`` nesting still
resolves against the scoped parent selector — exactly as it does under Yomitan.

#   * ``<``       — a ``</style>`` (or ``</STYLE >``) sequence would close the
