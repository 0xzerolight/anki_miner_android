        AND end time, so ``duration`` is ``0.0`` and every duration-based
        optional filter is inert by design.

        One tokenize pass per unit: ``_build_line_state`` tokenizes once and both

        headword — e.g. 呼ばる minted from the classical passive 呼ばれる (its ばる/ぶ
        suffix is outside ``morphology._FOLD_SUFFIX_PAIRS``). Such fronts miss the
        exact-term definition/frequency lookup and split dedup/known-word/audio
        identity from the base verb's card.

        * the lemma/orthBase readings DIVERGE (``lForm`` vs ``kanaBase``,
          hiragana-folded). LOAD-BEARING: okurigana spelling variants that read the
          same (変る/変わる, 表す/表わす — both readings equal) must NEVER remap, or
          the card front stops preserving the source orthography (Issue #19/#5).
          Mirrors ``mining_base``'s fold trigger, so an equal-reading token is left
          untouched.
        * ``orth_base`` differs from ``lemma`` by TRAILING OKURIGANA ONLY
          (``_differs_by_okurigana_only`` — same kanji stem). LOAD-BEARING: unidic's
          ``lemma`` canonicalizes kanji-variant homographs onto a different-kanji
          headword (帰れる→返る "can go home" vs "revert", 殺る→遣る, 混ぜる→交ぜる).
          Remapping onto such a lemma would ship the wrong homograph — so a kanji
          change blocks the remap and the source spelling is kept (its correct
          definition still arrives via the mined-form→lemma miss fallback).
        * the offline dictionary does NOT attest ``orth_base`` as a term (exact
          headword, no kana folding) — an attested front is a real word and is
          always KEPT; attestation, not a fold table, decides.
        * the dictionary DOES attest ``lemma`` — never remap onto an unattested
          target; keep the source spelling when there is nothing better.

        Reached only for a wired ``term_lookup`` and a token whose ``mining_base``
        did not fold (``orth_base`` is the token's own orthBase). Missing / ``*`` /
        non-string readings (synthetic compounds, OOV, MagicMock fakes) cannot

        (the seam that is ``None`` without a dict). Rationale: without a dict the

        an attested word abutting an unbroken katakana run (アイス|ベア) is rejected,
