        ``_emit_line_words_and_index`` so mining_base folding and lemma-tail
        stripping are inherited, never re-implemented here.

        Args:
            units: Ordered reading units (only ``.text``/``.index`` are read).
            want_line_index: When True, build the per-unit ``LineLemmas`` index
                (i+1 filter input) alongside the words; when False the index
                element of the returned tuple is ``None``.

        Returns:
            ``(words, line_index, counts)``. ``words`` is mined_form-deduped
            (first-occurrence-wins across the whole call, like the subtitle
            entrypoints); ``line_index`` is the ``LineLemmas`` list when
            ``want_line_index`` else ``None``; ``counts`` maps lemma → total
            included occurrences (``count_lemmas`` semantics, no dedup).
