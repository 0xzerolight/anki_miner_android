                pure-hiragana content words the script gate would drop (きれい,
                ある, すごい) are recovered iff their mined-form card front is an
                attested dictionary headword (by term OR reading — きれい is only
                a reading). ``None`` (no offline dict) safe-degrades to the
                pre-recovery behavior: all pure-hiragana content words dropped.
            term_lookup: Optional batch headword-existence probe
                (``DefinitionService.offline_terms_exist``). When provided,
                dictionary-attested multi-token spans are merged into single
                words (Yomitan longest-match). ``None`` (no offline dictionary
                or raw-entry-only callers) keeps parsing byte-identical to
                the pre-compound-matching behavior.
            name_lookup: Optional batch exact-membership probe over enabled
                name wordsets (``WordsetService.excluded_terms``). When
                provided, multi-token names are reconstructed from raw token
                surfaces so the later exact wordset filter sees the full name.
                Kept separate from ``term_lookup`` because name candidates
                must never deinflect an adjective-misclassified tail.
            reading_lookup: Optional batch attested-readings probe
                (``DefinitionService.offline_term_readings``). When provided,
                merged-compound kana is corrected to the dictionary's attested
                reading (``morphology.attest_merged_readings`` — the rendaku /
                on-kun junction fix, 2026-07 audit F2). Independent of the
                compound matcher: the morphology merges it serves
                (noun-suffix/prefix/nominalizer) run regardless.
                ``None`` keeps parsing byte-identical.
            mined_form_policy: Optional card-front policy
                (``languages.profile.MinedFormPolicy``) consulted at the emit
                site instead of ``models.word.select_mined_form``. ``None`` runs
                that JA function verbatim, which is what the drift canary pins.
                Duck-typed: ``services`` keeps no runtime import of
                ``languages``.
            reading_support: Optional word-reading provider
                (``languages.profile.ReadingSupport``) that owns the card's
                reading fields outright at the emit site. ``None`` — every JA
                path, since the ja profile's parser factory passes nothing —
                runs today's JA derivation verbatim. Duck-typed like
                ``mined_form_policy``.
            script_gate: Optional final script decision for the inclusion rule
                (``languages.profile.ScriptSupport.contains_target_script``).
                ``None`` — every JA path — keeps ``should_include``'s kanji /
                katakana / loanword ladder exactly as it was; a callable
                replaces only its last step, which is what lets a pure-hangul
                Korean word be mined at all.
            token_merger: Optional language-specific token-merge pass run on the
                merged stream, right after the JA compound-suffix passes
                (``languages.ko.predicate_merge.KoreanPredicateMerger``). Called
                as ``merge_line(text, tokens, attest)`` with the SAME memoised
                existence probe the compound matcher uses. ``None`` — every JA
                and ZH path — and any config with no offline dictionary (no
                probe to pass) skip it entirely, so output stays byte-identical.
                Duck-typed like ``mined_form_policy``.
            compound_matching: Whether the dictionary-attested compound matcher
                may run at all. The matcher joins adjacent tokens with "" and
                reads UniDic POS names, so a space-delimited language passes
                ``False`` through its ``create_parser`` (a spaced match would
                print ``NewYork``), as do zh/yue, whose jieba tags can never
                equal the UniDic POS the matcher stamps its synthetics with.
                ``True`` — every ja path, and ko today — keeps the pre-seam gate
                exactly: built whenever a term lookup is wired.
            form_lookup: Optional batch read of a term's ``(content, tags)`` rows
                from the enabled offline chain (spec R36,
                ``DefinitionService.offline_term_rows``). Handed to
                ``token_post_pass`` as its third argument and read NOWHERE else
                in this service, so only a language that injects a post-pass (or
                whose ``create_parser`` composes it into ``reading_lookup``, as uk
                does for S24) can reach it: every other path — ja/ko/zh included
                — is byte-identical whether this is wired or not. Hebrew's
                ``HebrewLemmaPass`` resolves a card front against the dictionary's
                own form table, which the existence-only ``term_lookup`` cannot do.
            token_post_pass: Optional language post-pass over the RAW tagger
                tokens (spec §4.3 item 2(b): separable-verb reattachment gated on
                dictionary attestation). Called once per line as
                ``token_post_pass(raw_tokens, attest, form_lookup)`` — ``attest``
                is the parser's memoised existence probe and ``form_lookup`` the
                R36 row read, both None without a dictionary — before every merge
                pass, and its result IS the line's raw token list. ``None`` —
                every ja/ko/zh path — runs nothing.
            normalize: The mining language's text normaliser for cue text and
                reading units (``LanguageProfile.normalize``), replacing the
                Japanese pair in :func:`clean_subtitle_text`. ``None`` — every
                ja/ko parser — keeps the Japanese pair.
            has_target_script: The mining language's script gate
                (``LanguageProfile.ScriptSupport.contains_target_script``),
                which makes :func:`clean_subtitle_text` drop the lines of a
                multi-line cue written in another script — the English half of
                a bilingual zh subtitle. ``None`` — every ja/ko path — keeps
                every physical line of every cue.
            ellipsis_fragment_guard: Whether the U8 truncation-fragment reject
                (``_is_ellipsis_truncation_fragment``) runs at all. Both of its
                signals read Japanese: a severed conjugation is recognised by a
                unidic ``cForm``, and a single-character surface is a cut word
                only where words are usually longer. A character-dense language
                passes ``False`` — 钱…钱不见了… is a line ABOUT 钱 — and the whole
                guard is skipped, neither half being able to mean for its tokens
                what it means for unidic's. ``True`` — every ja path — keeps the
                reject exactly as it was.
            sentence_annotation: Whether to generate the sentence
                furigana/reading fields from the token stream. They assume
                contiguous kana-bearing tokens: for a language with no
                ``LanguageProfile.sentence_annotator`` they print the sentence
                with its spaces deleted, so such a factory passes ``False`` and
                the fields stay empty.
            attested_reading_fallback: Spec S24. With an injected
                ``reading_support`` whose ``word_reading`` answers ``""``, take
                the card front's reading from the dictionary when exactly one
                attested reading exists (``resolve_attested_reading``): ru/uk's
                stressed headword (читать). Furigana and ``resolved_reading``
                stay ``""``. ``False`` — every ja/ko/zh path — leaves the
                injected branch as it was.
            force_include: The run's whitelist probe over a card front
                (``WordListService.is_whitelisted``), or None when the run
                honours no whitelist. A token every inclusion path rejects is
                still mined when its tag is one of the profile's
                ``rescuable_tags`` and this accepts its card front (R1). The
                front is the exact ``mined_form`` the word is emitted with, so a
                rescued word is always force-included in phase 2.
            defer_tagger: Acquire the tokenizer on first use instead of now: a
                caller that only reads lines (``parse_raw_entries``) never
                loads it.

        with this call's offset applied.
        A fingerprint mismatch (file edited or replaced between passes)

        Phase 1 remains cached for Phase 2, eliminating a second full MeCab pass

        The reading pipeline (manga volumes / novels / per-cue subtitles) hands
        mined text as ``ReadingUnit``s — one paragraph, manga text block, or
        subtitle cue each — instead of a subtitle file. Each unit's ``text`` is
        normalized for tokenization (the same ``normalize_for_tokenization`` +
        ``standardize_kanji_variants`` the subtitle path applies via
        ``clean_subtitle_text`` — mokuro OCR emits Kangxi radicals and halfwidth
        katakana that otherwise mis-tokenize), and that normalized form becomes
        the card sentence. There is no re-windowing, no pysubs2 and no per-file
        line cache on this path. ``unit.index`` (document order) doubles as the
        dummy start AND end time, so ``duration`` is ``0.0`` and every
        duration-based optional filter is inert by design.

        When ``subtitle_cleanup`` is set (the Reading→Subtitles per-cue path),
        each normalized unit additionally gets the subtitle-only annotation strip
        + user regex filter the video path applies via ``_clean_line_text``

        and no line-index entry. Manga/OCR and book units leave it ``False`` and
        are byte-identical to before.

        One tokenize pass per unit: ``_build_line_state`` tokenizes once and both
        the returned Counter and the emitted words reuse its ``merged_tokens``.
        The Counter accumulates over ``_iter_token_spans`` (NOT the raw
        ``merged_tokens``) so a span-undroppable token is excluded from the count
        exactly as it is from mining — the T-38 mine-vs-count consistency guard
        (see ``count_lemmas`` / ``_iter_token_spans``). Emission flows through
        ``_emit_line_words_and_index`` so mining_base folding and lemma-tail
        stripping are inherited, never re-implemented here.

        Args:
            units: Ordered reading units (only ``.text``/``.index`` are read).
            want_line_index: When True, build the per-unit ``LineLemmas`` index
                (i+1 filter input) alongside the words; when False the index
                element of the returned tuple is ``None``.
            subtitle_cleanup: When True (Reading→Subtitles cue kind), apply the
                subtitle-only annotation strip + user regex after normalization,

        clear ``should_include``'s >=2-char katakana floor. Attestation cannot
        catch them — the only signal is positional: the token sits INSIDE a longer
        unmerged katakana run in the raw line.

        Active ONLY with an offline dictionary wired, gated on the compound matcher
        (the seam that is ``None`` without a dict). Rationale: without a dict the
        matcher (see ``compound_matcher.merge_line``) can never merge a legit full
        run (スマホケース-class) into one synthetic upstream, so this positional
        rule would then reject BOTH halves of every real unspaced compound. No
        dict ⇒ returns ``False`` ⇒ mining is byte-identical to pre-guard behavior.

        A ``CompoundSyntheticToken`` is never a fragment: its span IS the merged
        full run (the matcher ran in ``_build_line_state`` before this guard), so
        it is exempt even when an unmerged katakana neighbor abuts it

        Rejects when the surface is all-katakana AND the raw-text char immediately

        a katakana-block char covering ー/ッ, but NOT the author-inserted separators
        ・/゠). Whitespace, ・, ゠ or any non-katakana between katakana does NOT
        continue a run — アイ ウォン stays two tokens, アイス・ベア keeps both halves,
        スマホ|と|バッグ keeps バッグ. An all-katakana verb is exempt only when the
        existing guarded front fold proves a non-katakana common headword
        (ゲーム|ヤラれた → やる); a front that stays katakana gets no exemption.
        Deliberate precision-over-recall (plan-decided): an attested katakana word
        abutting an unbroken run (アイス|ベア) is rejected, and legit adjacent
        loanword bigrams whose full run is no headword lose both halves — no
