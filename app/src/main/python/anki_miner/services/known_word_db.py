    under the language's comparison key (zh stores 頭髮 as 头发). Same pattern

    (D34-B), so cancelling a review writes nothing. Callers must not treat this
    as "persisted the moment the user clicked"; it is the commit step.

    Args:
        db_path: Path to the known-words SQLite database. Callers pass the
            active language's file — ``resolve_known_words_db_path(config)``,
            never the raw config field.
        forms: Set of ``mined_form`` strings the curator marked as known.
        language: The mining language ``db_path`` belongs to; its profile's
            ``dedup_fold`` keys the rows (see :class:`KnownWordDB`).
