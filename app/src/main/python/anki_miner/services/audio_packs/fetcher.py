class LocalAudioPackFetcher:
    """Fetches word pronunciation audio from a locally indexed audio pack.

    Conforms to the :class:`~anki_miner.interfaces.ExpressionAudioFetcher`
    Protocol structurally (never raises; returns Path or None).

    Cache strategy: successful hits are copied into *cache_dir* under a
    pack-prefixed name so Anki media filenames remain globally unique.
    Misses are NOT cached (no .miss markers) because local SQLite lookups are
    cheap — re-querying on every call avoids stale negatives after re-import.

    Connection idiom: a new read-only connection is opened per ``fetch`` call
    and closed in a finally block.  This avoids long-lived handles that would
    block pack removal or re-import on Windows (where open file handles
    prevent directory deletion).
