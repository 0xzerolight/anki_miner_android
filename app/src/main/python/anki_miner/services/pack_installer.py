"""Generic in-app installer for downloadable dependency packs.

Stateless, GUI-free service. A *pack* is a set of :class:`PackComponent`s —
each one top-level Python package (or data directory) pinned to a sha256-verified
artifact —
installed into one managed root directory that is then appended to
``sys.path`` so a plain ``import <name>`` resolves. Two adapters build on it:

* ``services/language_pack_installer.py`` — the per-language engine packs
  (``language_packs/<code>/``, manifests in ``languages/<code>/pack.py``),
  plus the read-only legacy ``ko_model/`` tier.
* ``services/asr/asr_pack_installer.py`` — the ASR engine pack
  (``asr_pack/``, manifest ``services/asr/asr_pack.py``): faster-whisper,
  CTranslate2, PyAV and their exclusive dependencies, which the frozen bundle
  excludes at Analysis time.

The rules the adapters share, and why:

* A component is satisfied by an extracted directory whose sentinels are all
  present AND whose declared root members sit beside it, or by a package
  importable from OUTSIDE the pack roots (a pip install with the matching extra
  needs no pack). The outside qualifier is load-bearing: a pack root is on
  ``sys.path`` as soon as any one of its components is complete, so from then on
  ``find_spec`` resolves the pack's OWN copy of every package it holds, and an
  importable tier that accepted that would report a damaged component — an
  antivirus quarantine of an extension module, a half-deleted package dir — as
  installed, disabling the one button that would repair it.
* Because the root IS the ``sys.path`` entry, a wheel's top-level siblings —
  kiwipiepy's ``_kiwipiepy.abi3.so``, or the auditwheel/delvewheel
  ``<pkg>.libs/`` directory whose shared libraries the extension resolves by an
  ``$ORIGIN``-relative rpath — are promoted there beside the package dir
  (``ArtifactSpec.root_members``; a prefix ending in ``/`` names a directory).
* Placement is atomic staging: members are extracted into a private staging dir
  *inside* the root (same filesystem), root members are promoted first and the
  package dir last with ``os.replace``, so no partial package is ever visible.
  The downloaded ``.part`` artifact is always removed (success, failure, or
  cancel).
