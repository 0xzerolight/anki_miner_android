"""Re-apply the latest self-contained glossary styling to already-mined cards.

Mining embeds glossary CSS inside each styled field as a TRAILING ``<style>``
block (``EpisodeProcessor._phase5_create`` → ``attach_card_style_block``;
trailing because a field-leading ``<style>`` is head-hoisted by DOMParser and
dropped from ``body.innerHTML`` round-trips — see the card_style_block module
docstring). Cohorts needing help once the styling format changes and re-mining
is blocked by known-words dedup:

- **Pre-v2.7.8 cards** lack the base stylesheet — either no ``<style>`` at all,
  or (for words matched against a dictionary that shipped a ``styles.css`` in
  v2.7.0–v2.7.7) only a per-dict ``<style>`` — so they render bare. Fixed by
  *appending* a fresh trailing block (after carried-CSS-gated stamping).
- **v2.7.8+ single-carrier cards** carry a LEADING base sheet on one field only
  (glossary when mapped, else definition) — lost on JS note types and absent
  from the other field. Fixed by *migrating* the block to the field tail
  (preserving the card's own ``dict_css`` tail + HTML body byte-for-byte) and
  attaching a fresh block to the other carrier field.
- **Current cards** carry a trailing base sheet per field frozen at their
  mine/restyle time; a later ``glossary.css`` change refreshes it in place.

Every mapped miner field (glossary AND definition) is a styling carrier and is
processed independently with field-only witnesses — the same contract as
mining/backfill, so the three writers converge byte-for-byte and a restyle
re-run is a no-op. Selection is markup-gated and idempotent (see
``restyle_mined_cards``); the write never touches note-type styling and never
re-collects a card's carried dictionary CSS (an uninstalled dict's CSS
survives in the field that carried it — it cannot be conjured for a field
that never carried any, which falls back to current-config CSS).

    """Stamp ``data-has-styles`` on legacy envelopes whose dictionary has scoped CSS.

    Fresh mining stamps the ``<li data-dictionary>`` envelope at render time
    (``IndexedDictProvider._render``) so the base sheet's gated data-sc-*
    gap-fillers stay off entries governed by their dictionary's own styles.css.
    Legacy bodies predate the stamp, and the restyler prepends a base sheet
    whose gap-fillers would out-specify the scoped dictionary CSS — reproducing
    the very bug the gate fixes — so the envelope must be stamped here too.

    An envelope is stamped iff its dictionary's scoped CSS is present in either
    stylesheet that will govern the restyled card: the body's own embedded
    per-dict ``<style>`` (covers renamed/uninstalled dictionaries) or the
    ``dict_css`` about to be prepended (the restyler injects current-config CSS,
    so its titles gate too; over-stamping is impossible — the block always
    carries the matching scoped CSS for any title it contributes). Only those two
    stylesheets are matched: a stray ``[data-dictionary="D"]`` selector baked into
    a legacy card body (e.g. an older manual edit) is a benign accepted edge, not
    a gate for dict D.

    The membership key re-derives the scoped-CSS selector prefix from the
    envelope attribute via the same forward escaper ``scope_dict_css`` uses
    (``html.unescape`` → ``css_string_escape``), so matching is exact for real
    titles and consistent even on the escaper's lossy ``<``/``>``-stripping
    path. ``re.sub`` with a replacement function is offset-safe for multi-dict
    bodies; already-stamped envelopes don't match the pattern (their ``<li``
    carries a second attribute), so the rewrite is idempotent.

    The caller compares against the input for the idempotent no-op. Two paths:

    **Extract/migrate** — the field carries OUR base block somewhere (a
    ``<style>`` whose inner CSS holds the ``ol[data-count]`` token: that
    selector token appears only in our minified base — ``<ol data-count=`` in
    markup is a different string — and never in a legacy per-dict block, so
    ownership can't false-positive; a pre-v2.7.8-migrated card legitimately
    carries TWO ``<style>``s, its own per-dict one inside the envelope plus
    ours). The block is removed from wherever it sits (legacy head or current
    tail), its ``dict_css`` tail (after the first ``\\n`` — the minified base is
    newline-free, pinned in ``card_style_block``) is preserved VERBATIM — never
    re-collected, so an uninstalled dictionary keeps its CSS — and the block is
    re-emitted at the field TAIL with a freshly witness-selected base. Envelope
    stamping is gated on the card's OWN carried CSS (body blocks via
    ``key in value``, the carried tail via the ``dict_css`` membership arg),
    NEVER current config — stamping a config-only-governed envelope would
    switch the base gap-fillers OFF with no card CSS to replace them.

    **Fresh-attach** — no block of ours anywhere (pre-v2.7.8 bare or per-dict
    bodies, or the never-carrier field of a single-carrier card). The body is
    stamped FIRST with today's legacy-prepend gate (carried per-dict ``<style>``
    via ``key in value`` OR current config via ``key in dict_css`` — an
    unstamped body would witness the unstyled-dict groups whose gap-fillers
    out-specify the dict's own scoped CSS, re-opening Issue #87, and would
    break rerun convergence), then a trailing block is appended with
    current-config CSS filtered to the dictionaries present in the stamped
    body (``filter_dict_css_entries`` — the same per-field filter mining and
    backfill use, so all three writers converge byte-for-byte). NOT routed
    through ``attach_card_style_block``: that helper is stampless by contract.

    Both paths witness the STAMPED body of THIS FIELD ONLY — stamping must
    precede the variant computation (the unstyled-dict witness keys on the
    unstamped envelope; witnessing pre-stamp would flip the variant between
    runs), and cross-field witnessing would diverge from mining's per-field
    blocks and rewrite fresh cards forever.

    ``_restyle_field``: our base block (wherever it sits — legacy leading head
