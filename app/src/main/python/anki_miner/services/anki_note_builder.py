    Goes deliberately STRICTER than Anki in exactly one place: zero-width format

    created. This filter is the only layer that can catch it, so it must.
    Stripping can only make the filter match more, and two strings differing
    only by zero-width characters are the same word on screen.

    Order matters: the strip runs after ``html.unescape`` so an escaped
