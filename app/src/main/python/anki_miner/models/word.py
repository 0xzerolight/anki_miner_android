        """The form that becomes the card front (Expression field).

        Verbs and adjectives mine as the dictionary form so that ``破れ``
        becomes ``破れる`` — the learner studies the form that
        recognizes/produces every conjugation (Issue #19). The dictionary
        form used is ``orth_base`` (source orthography), NOT ``lemma``:
        unidic's canonical lemma silently swaps kanji variants
        (乞う→請う, 喰らう→食らう) and the card must keep the spelling the
        sentence actually used. Yomitan behaves the same way — it
        deinflects the raw string and never normalizes to a canonical
        headword. ``lemma`` remains the fallback when ``orth_base`` is
        empty. Definition and frequency lookups also key on ``mined_form``
        (with a miss-only ``lemma`` fallback) so the fetched data matches
        the spelling the card shows — 殺る must not get 遣る's "to do"
        definition or 掛ける's rank; only pitch stays lemma-keyed
        (variants share the reading, canonical orthography has the better
        hit rate in reading-scoped pitch CSVs). The one exception: when the
        JMdict verb-front resolver overrides ``orth_base`` (感じた: 感ずる →
        感じる), the front's reading (かんじる) diverges from the archaic
        lemma's own (感ずる→かんずる), so ``resolved_reading`` carries the
        front reading and the pitch sites prefer it over ``lemma_reading``.
        Kana-surface verbs never reach mining (TokenInclusionRule requires
        kanji or katakana), so orthBase-vs-lemma only ever differs on
        kanji-surface variant tokens. Verbs carded before this change
        stored the normalized lemma and will re-card once as the source
        variant (accepted, no migration — see CHANGELOG).

        ``orth_base`` arrives pre-folded by ``morphology.mining_base``:
        derived sub-lemma entries (potential 保てる, ra-nuki 見れる,
        adjective ク-form 良し) collapse onto their parent lemma
        (保つ/見る/良い) so they dedup against the base-form card. The fold
        boundary is unidic's classification — 思える/起きれる fold to
        思う/起きる while lexicalized 見える/聞こえる/できる keep their own
        entries — and the suffix-pair guard keeps every lemma
        canonicalization unfolded (kanji swaps 帰れる→返る/出逢える→出会う,
        okurigana variants 表せる→表わす, modern→archaic 信じる→信ずる all
        mine their source orthBase). Stem tokens like 信じ (from
        信じられない) still mine 信ずる — pre-existing quirk, readings
        equal, never triggers the fold. Cards mined as potential forms
        before this change get a base-lemma sibling next time the word
        recurs (one-time re-card burst, broader than the orthBase
        precedent above; accepted — see CHANGELOG).

        Nouns and other non-conjugating POS keep the surface form: unidic
        sometimes maps homograph-like nouns to a different headword
        (``豪腕`` → ``剛腕``); preserving surface for nouns avoids that
        regression (Issue #5).
