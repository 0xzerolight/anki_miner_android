    A katakana 代名詞 in the curated ``_KATAKANA_PRONOUN_FOLDS`` map (ワタシ→私,

    Nouns whose surface is the lemma plus a 1-2 char colloquial vowel-elongation

        Verbs and adjectives mine as the dictionary form so that ``破れ``
        becomes ``破れる`` — the learner studies the form that
        recognizes/produces every conjugation (Issue #19). The dictionary
        form used is ``orth_base`` (source orthography), NOT ``lemma``:
        unidic's canonical lemma silently swaps kanji variants
        (乞う→請う, 喰らう→食らう) and the card must keep the spelling the
        sentence actually used. Yomitan behaves the same way — it
        deinflects the raw string and never normalizes to a canonical
        headword. ``lemma`` remains the fallback when ``orth_base`` is
        empty. Definition, frequency, glossary, pitch, and expression-audio
        lookups key on ``mined_form``. A miss retries ``lemma`` only when the
        spelling differs by trailing okurigana over the same kanji stem; a
        different-kanji UniDic lemma may be another homograph. Thus fetched
        data matches the spelling the card shows — 殺る must not get 遣る's
        "to do" definition or 掛ける's rank. Definition fallback may still use
        rules-validated deinflection of ``mined_form``. When the JMdict
        verb-front resolver overrides ``orth_base`` (感じた: 感ずる → 感じる),
        the front's reading (かんじる) diverges from the archaic lemma's own
        (感ずる→かんずる), so ``resolved_reading`` carries the front reading and
        the identity-safe pitch fallback prefers it over ``lemma_reading``.
        Kana-surface verbs never reach mining (TokenInclusionRule requires
        kanji or katakana), so orthBase-vs-lemma only ever differs on
        kanji-surface variant tokens. Verbs carded before this change
        stored the normalized lemma and will re-card once as the source
        variant (accepted, no migration — see CHANGELOG).

        ``orth_base`` arrives pre-folded by ``morphology.mining_base``:
        derived sub-lemma entries (potential 保てる, ra-nuki 見れる,
        adjective ク-form 良し) collapse onto their parent lemma
        (保つ/見る/良い) so they dedup against the base-form card. The fold
        boundary is unidic's classification — 思える/起きれる fold to
        思う/起きる while lexicalized 見える/聞こえる/できる keep their own
        entries — and the suffix-pair guard keeps every lemma
        canonicalization unfolded (kanji swaps 帰れる→返る/出逢える→出会う,
        okurigana variants 表せる→表わす, modern→archaic 信じる→信ずる all
        mine their source orthBase). Stem tokens like 信じ (from
        信じられない) still mine 信ずる — pre-existing quirk, readings
        equal, never triggers the fold. Cards mined as potential forms
        before this change get a base-lemma sibling next time the word
        recurs (one-time re-card burst, broader than the orthBase
        precedent above; accepted — see CHANGELOG).

        Nouns and other non-conjugating POS keep the surface form: unidic
        sometimes maps homograph-like nouns to a different headword
        (``豪腕`` → ``剛腕``); preserving surface for nouns avoids that
        regression (Issue #5). The one carve-out: a 名詞 surface that is the
        lemma plus a short colloquial vowel-elongation tail (``手ぇ`` → ``手``,
        ``気い`` → ``気``) folds to the lemma when its spelling or UniDic
        pronunciation proves elongation — see ``select_mined_form`` for the guards.
