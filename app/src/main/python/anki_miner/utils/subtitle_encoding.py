"""Shared pysubs2 encoding fallback (BOM, caller's ladder, detector).

Japanese subtitle files are frequently cp932/Shift-JIS, but pysubs2 defaults to
UTF-8 and raises :class:`UnicodeDecodeError` on them. Both the Audio Condenser
(``services/audio_condenser.py``) and the mining parser
(``services/subtitle_parser.py``) do a UTF-8 ``pysubs2.load`` first — keeping
their own patchable seam and per-call-site exception handling — and, on a UTF-8
decode failure, delegate the retry to :func:`load_with_fallback_encoding` here so
the fallback chain lives in exactly one place.

:func:`detect_subtitle_encoding` runs that same chain for a caller that needs the
*name* of the encoding rather than a parsed file — subtitle retiming, which
declares it to alass via ``--encoding-inc``.

The ladder itself belongs to the caller: a config-bearing site passes
``encodings=get_profile(config_language(config)).import_encodings``, so a Chinese
subtitle is tried against gb18030/big5 and a Korean one against cp949. The
"use the built-in ladder" sentinel is ``None``, never ``()`` — an empty tuple is
an EMPTY ladder that silently stops every non-UTF-8 subtitle decoding.
