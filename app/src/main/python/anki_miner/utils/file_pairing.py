#: Mining subtitle formats, best first. Richest format wins when a folder holds

#: parse. SAMI (.smi), the long-standing Korean fansub format, is poorer still:

    1. Exact stem: ``EP01.srt`` or the Retime output ``EP01_retimed.srt``.

                own set (Condense supplies its own so its media-side extensions

                (F7), matched to the same videos by the same episode-number
                rule and hung off each pair's ``secondary``.  It has to be a
