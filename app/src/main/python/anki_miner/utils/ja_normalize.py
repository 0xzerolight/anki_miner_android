"""Pre-tokenization Japanese text normalization.

An ordered normalization chain applied to cleaned subtitle text *before* it
reaches MeCab, so that input classes which silently break tokenization are
folded to their canonical forms first: halfwidth katakana (ﾊﾟｿｺﾝ), NFD kana
(か + U+3099), CJK-compatibility ligatures (㌀ ㍿ ㍻) and OCR Kangxi-radical
substitutions (⼀ U+2F00 for 一 U+4E00).

Ported from Yomitan (GPL-3.0), upstream commit ``e2ed450``:

======================================  ===================================================

Owned deviations from Yomitan (see the pinned plan item 1.3):

* Combining-character normalization uses stdlib :func:`unicodedata.normalize`
  ``NFC`` rather than a port of Yomitan's guarded ``normalizeCombiningCharacters``.
  NFC composes more than U+3099/U+309A (any canonical composition anywhere in
  the line), which Yomitan's guarded fold avoids because it must preserve the
  on-screen lookup string byte-for-byte. Here the cleaned line *is* the stored
  card sentence and canonical composition is non-destructive for subtitle text,
  so stdlib NFC is chosen for reuse. Observable consequences vs the guarded
  fold: compositions outside Yomitan's ``dakutenAllowed`` ranges also fold —
  the archaic katakana ワ/ヰ/ヱ/ヲ + U+3099 compose to ヷ/ヸ/ヹ/ヺ (the case the
  Yomitan test corpus pins), and likewise う/ウ + U+3099 → ゔ/ヴ — strictly
  more canonical, harmless for MeCab input.

* NFC runs as the *final* step of :func:`normalize_for_tokenization`, not at the
  position the plan's prose numbered it. The compat/radical steps are faithful
  per-character NFKD ports, and NFKD leaves katakana decomposed (パ → ハ + U+309A;
  Yomitan's own unit test asserts this decomposed output). Running NFC last
  recomposes that output so MeCab receives precomposed kana — the whole point of
  the chain. NFC is idempotent and non-destructive, so its position only affects
  whether decompositions introduced by *later* steps get recomposed.

* :func:`strip_decoration_glyphs` is not a Yomitan step at all — an owned
  addition run *first* in the chain. TV-caption sources (broadcast 字幕)
  decorate lines with continuation arrows (➡), device/speaker glyphs (📱) and
  renderer private-use codepoints; a 2026-07 audit of 729 mined cards found ➡
  on 42% of sentences. Yomitan never sees such text (its input is user-selected
  words); mined card sentences do, so the strip is owned here. Length-changing,
  hence pre-tokenization only — offsets are always computed after this chain.
