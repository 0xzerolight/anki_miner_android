"""Stage-weighted progress adapter.

The mining pipeline reports progress per stage: media extraction, definition
lookup, optional glossary lookup, and card creation each call
``on_start -> on_progress -> on_complete`` independently. Forwarded straight to
the GUI, that resets and refills the bar 0->100 once per stage, so the bar hits
100% at the end of media extraction (stage 1 of 4) long before mining finishes.

``StageWeightedProgress`` wraps the real callback and maps each stage's local
progress into a contiguous band of one global 0->100 sweep. It auto-advances to
the next band on every ``on_start``, so callers only supply the per-run weight
list (one entry per reporting stage, in firing order) and otherwise pass it
through unchanged. The caller signals the end of the whole sweep with an
explicit :meth:`finish` — not all stages reliably fire ``on_complete`` (e.g.
card creation early-returns on an empty batch), so completion must not be
inferred from per-stage events.

Only the *first* stage's ``on_start`` is forwarded to ``inner`` (it configures
the bar at max=100 once). A later stage's ``on_start`` must never re-forward
``on_start`` — that would reset the bar to 0 and drop the percent. Instead it
emits a single ``on_progress`` at the banked cursor carrying the new stage's
description, so downstream row labels refresh to the current stage without any
bar reset (and stay monotone, since the banked cursor is where the prior stage
left off).
