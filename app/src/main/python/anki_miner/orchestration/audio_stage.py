"""Expression- and sentence-audio stage extracted from ``EpisodeProcessor``.

This is the one seam the god-module keep-verdict sanctions: the audio cluster
touches no pipeline ctx — only the two fetchers, the presenter, the config
gates, and a live cancelled check — so it lifts cleanly out of the phase
methods, which stay inline. ``EpisodeProcessor`` still constructs and closes
the fetchers; :class:`AudioStage` only orchestrates the per-run fetch loops and
their progress-band accounting.

The two fetch entry points are structural clones (source-priority word audio vs
memoized sentence TTS); they share one cancel-aware loop skeleton
(:meth:`AudioStage._run_stage`) and one diagnosis helper
(:meth:`AudioStage._diagnose`).
