        :meth:`_materialize_line_expansions` afterwards, from the same intent
        the curator stamps by hand — this pass adds no merging code of its own.
        ``parse_raw_entries`` is re-parsed at the offset the words carry, the
        SAME call the materialiser makes, so ``find_cue_index`` sees one
        timeline on both sides. The guard returns before the parse, so a run
        with the setting off is unchanged down to the parse count.

        A word whose cue cannot be located keeps its fragment: the curator
        resolves the cue with the same function against the same texts, and a
        guess here would put the two out of step.

        Sentence dedup and the sentence-length caps run again here, on the
        sentence and window the card is ABOUT to carry: phase 2 judged the raw
        cue, two words on adjacent cues converge on one merged sentence (exactly
        the duplicate ``deduplicate_by_sentence`` exists to drop), and a
        fragment that passed the caps can grow past them. Both run before
        curation on purpose — dropping a word after the user has reviewed and
        kept it would be worse than not merging at all — and under phase 2's
        own gates, so a run that skipped a filter there skips it here too.

        Under i+1 a merge is refused, not filtered: a window whose cues carry
        more than one unknown word (``line_index`` against phase 2's
        ``unknown_lemmas``/``unknown_fronts`` snapshot) would hand an i+1 card
        an i+2 sentence, so the word keeps its i+1 fragment (P5). Force-included

        Args:
            video_file: Path to video file.
            subtitle_file: Path to subtitle file.
            progress_callback: Optional progress callback.
            curation_callback: Optional callback for word curation. Receives
                filtered words. Returns the user-selected subset (an empty list
                means "confirmed with nothing selected" → a completed run with
                zero new cards), or ``None`` if the user cancelled/rejected the

                passed to stats_service. When ``None`` (default) the identity
                is derived from ``video_file.stem`` (preserves current file-based
                flow). Used by ``process_youtube_url`` to record
                ``YT:<video_id>``.
            series_name_override: Optional override for the series identity
                passed to stats_service. When ``None`` the identity is derived
                from ``video_file.parent.name``.
            audio_track_override: Optional 0-indexed audio track to extract instead of
                auto-detecting Japanese. None (default) preserves existing JP auto-detect behavior.
            source_label_override: Optional override for the card "source" field
                origin. When ``None`` (default) the origin is built from the
                resolved series/episode identity as ``"<series> — <episode>"``
                (em dash, U+2014). Used by ``process_youtube_url`` to stamp the
                actual video title instead of the synthetic ``YT:<video_id>``.
            audio_only: If True (audiobook mining), media extraction skips
                per-word screenshots and reuses the file's embedded cover art
                instead. False (default) preserves existing video behavior.
            cancel_event: Optional threading event set by a worker on
                cancellation. When provided it is bridged into this run's
                phase checkpoints and the media extractor's cancelled_check
                (via :attr:`cancelled`) for the duration of this call only —
                workers must use this instead of the sticky :meth:`cancel`,
                which poisons shared processors across runs (see __init__).
            subtitle_offset: Seconds to shift subtitle timings by for THIS call
                only. ``None`` (default) leaves the parser on its own
                ``config.subtitle_offset``. The batch queue runs one processor
                over items with different offsets and passes each item's here,
                so a per-item config copy (and the per-item service rebuild it
                forced) is no longer needed.
            secondary_subtitle_file: A second subtitle file in another language
                (F7). Parsed once at a ZERO offset; each surviving word gets the
                cues overlapping its final sentence window as
                ``sentence_translation``. None (every path but Video -> Single
                with the feature on) leaves the field "".
            secondary_subtitle_offset: Seconds to shift that track by, applied
                at match time so the curator, which holds the same zero-offset
                cues, can move the offset without a re-parse.
            _outer_kind: Private seam for ``process_youtube_url``: the run's
                ``Pipeline start``/``Pipeline end`` receipt was already stamped
                by that outer entry point (which owns the fetch stage this call
                cannot see), so this call stamps none and only inherits the
                ``kind`` for the terminal failure line. ``None`` — every other
                caller — makes this call the receipt owner.

        Returns:
            ProcessingResult with statistics.

        Raises:
            SetupError: note type / field mapping is misconfigured, or no usable
                offline dictionary is installed.

          warning, the archive is skipped for every remaining ref.
        * A ``zipfile.BadZipFile`` means the whole archive is corrupt/unusable —
          same per-archive skip-and-warn-once handling.
        * A ``PIL.UnidentifiedImageError`` / ``OSError`` (corrupt or undecodable
          page, or a missing codec in a frozen bundle) is per-ref: one warning
          naming the page, that word goes imageless, the rest of the archive
          stays readable.

        Warnings fire once per failing archive/ref (``failed_archives`` /
        ``failed_refs`` memos) even when the ref is shared by many words.

        method only writes into it via the fetcher; cleanup (``rmtree``) is the
        caller's responsibility, typically in a ``try/finally``.

        Episode identity recorded to stats_service is ``YT:<video_id>`` with
        series ``YouTube`` for YouTube, and ``<site>:<video_id>`` with series
        ``<site>`` for another site (``VideoInfo.site``), so online rows never
        collide with file-based folders that share a stem.

        Args:
            url: YouTube video URL (or anything yt-dlp accepts).
            video_id: Pre-extracted video_id; must match the ID yt-dlp will
                write file names with (the worker takes it from probe_metadata).
            workspace: Pre-created, caller-owned directory that yt-dlp writes
                the video and subtitle files into.
            sub_mode: "manual_only", "auto_only", "auto_dub" or "transcribe" —
                resolved from what probe_metadata reported as available and what
                subtitle source the run asked for ("auto_dub" pairs the
                machine-translated ja captions with the Japanese auto-dub audio
                track; "transcribe" downloads no captions and generates the
                subtitle locally from the video's audio).
            fallback_allowed: Forwarded to the fetcher. When True (the worker
                passes ``VideoInfo.has_auto_ja_subs``), a ``manual_only`` fetch may
                fall back to the video's *native* auto-captions if the listed manual
                track is unavailable at download time. Gated on the probe's verdict
                so the fallback can never reach a machine-translated track.
            cancel_event: Threading event set by the worker on cancellation;
                forwarded to the fetcher so in-flight yt-dlp can be killed,
                and passed through to ``process_episode``, which bridges it
                into the mining pipeline's cancellation checkpoints (via
                :attr:`cancelled`) for the duration of this run only.
            progress_callback: Optional ``ProgressCallback`` forwarded to
                ``process_episode`` for mining-phase reporting (media extract,
                definitions, card creation).
            fetch_progress_cb: Optional ``(label, frac)`` callable forwarded
                to ``YouTubeFetcherService.fetch_video`` for download-phase
                reporting. ``frac`` is in [0.0, 1.0] or ``None`` for
                indeterminate stages (merging, post-processing).
            curation_callback: Optional callback for word curation. Forwarded
                unchanged to ``process_episode``; see its docstring for semantics.
            on_fetched: Optional callback invoked with the ``FetchedMedia``
                result after download completes, before the mining pipeline
                starts. Called on the calling thread (the worker thread).
            align_captions: Retime *fetched* captions against the video's audio
                before mining (the tab's per-run checkbox). Ignored in
                "transcribe" mode, where the subtitle already came from that
                audio. Best-effort: a failed alignment keeps the original file.
            site: Where the video lives (``VideoInfo.site``): "YouTube", or
                another site's name ("Bilibili"). Names the run's identity.
            source_label: Optional origin string for the card "source" field
                (typically the YouTube video title). Forwarded to
                ``process_episode`` as ``source_label_override``. The stats/dedup
                identity (``YT:<video_id>`` / ``YouTube``) is unaffected.

        Returns:
            ProcessingResult from the mining pipeline, with episode identity
            overridden to the online identity above (``YT:<video_id>`` on YouTube).
